# Introduction-to-Mathematics
Goal: Make introduction to Mathematics (Analysis for now) rigorous, but intuitive.

Preamble: I have been frustrated by how unintuitive math analysis has been.
          It is easy to get losts in the details and have no idea what it is we are even talking about.
          I want to approach it in a way that introduces the concepts gently by: 
            Giving motivation to what we are doing and why we are learning this
            Introducing the ideas with physical examples
            Retain as many details without getting lost -- This will require pushing some details under the rug to understand the full picture first
            
The outline so far:
  Calculus + Real Analysis
  Linear Algebra
  Probability
  Partial Differential Equations
  Numerical Analysis
  Physics
