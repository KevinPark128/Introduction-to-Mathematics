# Introduction-to-Mathematics
## Goal: Make mathematics intuitive.

### Preamble: 
I have been frustrated by how unintuitive math analysis has been. It is easy to get lost in the details and have no idea what it is we are            even talking about and so I want to approach mathematics in a way that introduces the concepts gently.
            
### The outline so far:
  Calculus + Real Analysis
  
  Linear Algebra
  
  Probability
  
  Partial Differential Equations
  
  Numerical Analysis
  
  Physics
